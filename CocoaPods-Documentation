Cocoa Pods Installation:


Do steps 1-4 if Cocoapods is not installed in your MAC Machine
1. sudo gem update --system 
   (to install Ruby)

2. ruby -v    
    (to check ruby version)

Note: If ruby version is less then use following commands

rm -rf ~/.rvm

curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable


3. (Install cocoa pods before installing pods)
sudo gem install cocoapods -V 

		or 

   sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods  
   (This is becauase of SIP in new MAC OSX)


4. pod setup  
   (after cocoapods is installed. This process will likely take a while as this command clones the CocoaPods Specs repository into ~/.cocoapods/ on your computer.)




Do steps from 5 if Cocoapods is already installed in your MAC Machine
5. Go to your project directory and run
	pod init

This will generate a file "PodFile"

6. Go to your project directory and run
	pod install

7. Now open new new file created  "YourProjectName.xcworkspace". Don't use "YourProjectName.xcodeproj" from now.

8. To add a GitHub library write below example in "PodFile"

pod 'Reachability'

And run pod install in terminal

For updating cocoa pods installed on your system, execute below line

sudo gem install cocoapods

Cocoa Pods Uninstallation:

Step 1) To check which versions of the cocoapds are installed on the local machine

        sudo gem list --local | grep cocoapods


        It will show somthing like this:

		cocoapods-deintegrate (1.0.1)
		cocoapods-downloader (1.1.3)
		cocoapods-plugins (1.0.0)
		cocoapods-search (1.0.0)
		cocoapods-stats (1.0.0)
		cocoapods-trunk (1.1.2)
		cocoapods-try (1.1.0)


Step 2) To uninstall each version we have to run the following commands

		It will uninstall the very first cocoa pods installed in the system:

        sudo gem uninstall cocoapods-deintegrate

        Similarly we have to repeat this process for each and every cocoa pods installed in the local system.
